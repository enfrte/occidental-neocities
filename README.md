# Occidental language

Welcome to my personal page about the Occidental language.

Occidental AKA Interlingue, is an international auxiliary language created in 1922. Its creator, Edgar de Wahl, sought to achieve maximal grammatical regularity and natural character. The vocabulary is based on pre-existing words from various languages and a derivational system which uses recognized prefixes and suffixes.
